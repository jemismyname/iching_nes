Porting the I Ching (Chinese Taoist Book of Changes) to the 8 bit NES.  The plan is to implement this oracle on a number of different devices (phones, game consoles, handheld gaming devices, etc)... because, why not, right?  

Further plan is to implement more ancient oracles such as the Mayan Tzolkin "synchronometer"/calendar and the chinese Lao Pan(sp?) or geomantic compass.
